# ExceptionHandlingContract

The `ExceptionHandlingContract` is a Solidity smart contract that demonstrates the usage of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements for exception handling in Ethereum smart contract development.

## Contract Details

- Solidity Version: ^0.8.0

## Functions

### `setValue(uint256 _newValue)`

Sets the `value` variable to a new value. It uses the `require()` statement to validate that the new value is greater than zero. If the condition is not met, the transaction is reverted with the specified error message.

### `getValue()`

Retrieves the current value stored in the `value` variable.

### `performOperation(uint256 _amount)`

Performs an operation that subtracts a specified amount from the `value` variable. It uses the `assert()` statement to validate that the specified amount is less than or equal to the current value. If the condition is not satisfied, the transaction is reverted. Additionally, if the resulting `value` becomes zero after the operation, it explicitly reverts the transaction with an error message.

## Usage

1. Compile the smart contract using a Solidity compiler that supports version ^0.8.0.

2. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network of your choice.

3. Interact with the deployed contract using the provided functions (`setValue()`, `getValue()`, `performOperation()`).

## Development

1. Clone the repository.

2. Install the required dependencies.

3. Make the necessary changes to the contract or create new contracts as per your requirements.

4. Test the contract using a testing framework such as Truffle or Hardhat.
   
5. Compile and deploy the contract to an Ethereum network.

6. Update the readme file with relevant information about your specific project.
